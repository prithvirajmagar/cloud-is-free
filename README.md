This site aims to help those wishing to set up practical projects through an interactive and detailed documentation, and this while taking advantage of the Free Tier from Cloud platforms.

**No more fear of receiving a hefty bill:** follow these steps properly and deploy your first Cloud projects for cheap.

### You will learn how to :
- Deploy a static website;
- Create a Serverless sending application;
- Create and manipulate databases using containers;

and other projects that will come in the future.

The projects are currently deployed on AWS, but will be deployed on other Cloud platforms in the future.

Ready to start your first project? Then head to the Projects section.
